# Javascript Theory

### Datatypes
- undefined : not assigned
- null
- boolean
- string
- symbol : immutable symbol
- number
- object : Set of key-value pairs.

### Declare:
`var myName = "Abu";` Declare and assigned

later

`myName = 1;`

Apart from var you can use let

`let ourName = "Khan";`

let will only be used within a scope of declaration. but var can be used globally.

Or use const

`const num = 5;`

immutable
